Tentative Schedule

Week #1:

•  Lecture #1 – The Android Platform

•  Lecture #2 – The Android Development Environment

•  Lab #1: Setup: Students identify required software & install it on their personal computers.  Students perform several tasks to familiarize themselves with the Android Platform and Development Environment. 

Week #2:

•  Lecture #3 – Application Fundamentals

•  Lecture #4 – The Activity Class

•  Lab #2 – The Activity Lifecycle & Reconfiguration: Students build applications that trace the lifecycle callback methods issued by the Android platform and that demonstrate Android's behavior when the device configuration changes (e.g., when the device moves from portrait to landscape mode and back).

Week #3:

•  Lecture #5 – The Intent Class

•  Lecture #6 – Permissions

•  Lecture #7 – The Fragment Class

•  Lab #3a - Intents & Permissions:  Students build applications that require starting multiple Activities via both standard and custom Intents.

•  Lab #3b - Permissions:  Students build applications that require standard and custom permissions.

•  Lab #3c – Multi-pane and single-pane User Interfaces: Students build an application that uses a single code base, but creates different user interfaces depending on a device's screen size. 

Week #4: 

• Lectures #8 – User Interface Classes - Part I

• Lectures #9 – User Interface Classes - Part II

• Lab #4 – ToDoManager:  Students build a ToDo list manager using the user interface elements discussed in lecture. The application allows users to create new ToDo Items and to display them in a ListView. 

Week #5:

• Lecture #10 – User Notifications

• Lecture #11 – The BroadcastReceiver Class

• Lecture #12 – Threads, AsyncTask & Handlers

• Lecture #13 - Alarms

• Lecture #14 - Networking

• Lab #5a – Threads: We'll write concurrent, multi-threaded code to load ToDo items from a networked server via background threads (i.e., without blocking the main UI thread).

• Lab #5b - Broadcast Receiver: We'll build an application that uses a BroadcastReceiver to react when events such as connecting and disconnecting the charger occur.

Week #6:

• Lecture #15 – Graphics & Animation I

• Lecture #16 – Graphics & Animation II

• Lecture #17 – Multi-touch & Gestures

• Lecture #18 – MultiMedia

• Lab #6a - Gesture Sampler:  Students build and application that accepts gesture input, such as using an "X" gesture to delete, using a "?" gesture to show help, etc.

• Lab #6b - Bubble Popper: We'll write an application to display and animate bubbles (graphics that look like bubbles) on the device's screen. When users touch the screen where a bubble appears, the bubble pops.

Week #7:

• Lecture #19 – Sensors

• Lecture #20 – Location & Maps

• Lab #7a - Obstacle Course: Students build an application that uses the orientation of the device (tilting, rotating, etc.) to guide an object around obstacles. 

Week #8:

• Lecture #21 – DataManagement

• Lecture #22 – The ContentProvider Class

• Lecture #23 – The Service Class

• Lab #8a - Data Management (SQL): Students develop a database for storing and retrieving multimedia notes with textual tags.

• Lab #8b - Mutlimedia Notes Content Provider: Students extend the multimedia notes database so multimedia notes can be shared via a ContentProvider across multiple applications. 

Final Project: iRemember

       We'll implement the front end of a complex handheld application involving many of the concepts presented in the class.
